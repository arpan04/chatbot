# chatbot
I created a chatbot by training it on a corpus using chatterbot python library.ChatterBot is a Python library that makes it easy to generate automated responses to a userâ€™s input. ChatterBot uses a selection of machine learning algorithms to produce different types of responses.  I also added the corpus in this repository.
